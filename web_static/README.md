### Background Context

In the vast realm of web development, creating a dynamic and visually appealing user interface is a crucial step. The "AirBnB Clone - Web static" project is designed to guide you through the process of building the frontend elements of your AirBnB application incrementally.

Before diving into the complexities of a large web application, we'll take the first steps:

1. **Create Simple HTML Static Pages:**

   - Develop static HTML pages as a foundation for your application.
   - Think of this as sketching or prototyping each element of your web application.

2. **Style Guide:**

   - Establish a style guide to maintain consistency in the appearance of your web pages.
   - Define the visual elements such as colors, fonts, and layout.

3. **Fake Contents:**

   - Populate your static pages with placeholder or fake contents.
   - This allows you to design and structure your pages without worrying about dynamic data.

4. **No Javascript:**

   - Focus solely on HTML and CSS for now; no need for Javascript in this phase.
   - Javascript will be introduced in later stages of the project.

5. **No Data Loaded from Anything:**
   - For simplicity, avoid loading data dynamically from a database or external sources.
   - Concentrate on creating a visually appealing and functional static interface.

Throughout this project, you will gain valuable experience in manipulating HTML and CSS, the foundational languages for web development.
